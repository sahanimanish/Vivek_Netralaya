            Paediatric Ophthalmologist – Choosing the Best Eye Doctor for Kids

          Children are not miniature adults. Their eyes, visual needs, and
          disorders are entirely different than from those of adults. Since they
          are rapidly growing, and are yet to develop a fully mature eye-brain
          coordination, disorders of vision in children require special
          attention and focus. This is why pediatric ophthalmology has evolved
          as a specialized discipline, and indeed a subspecialty in
          ophthalmology
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          The pediatric ophthalmologist is responsible for taking care of the
          visual attention needs of the children, and ensuring a proper visual
          development regarding both function and structure (including
          cosmesis).

          <h2>How is the eye of the child different?</h2>
          
        </div class="mt-3">
        <p class="ml-2">
            Just as a particular doctor is required for your child’s general
            health, even the eyes of a child need specialist care. It is because
            the considerations in terms of eye care are entirely different from
            those in adults. The reasons for this are as follows:
          </p>
        <ul class="ml-3">
          <li class="mt-2">
            The brain-eye connections are not fully made, so any deprivation of
            vision in early childhood, if it remains uncorrected, can result in
            lazy eye or amblyopia. These means that the visual potential of the
            child becomes limited, and even proper corrective glasses cannot
            help in later help. Amblyopia therapy is critical in the early years
            of life
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            The congenital anomalies or disorders of development show up in the
            early years of life. These can range for refractive errors which
            merely require corrective glasses, to squint or misalignment of
            eyes, congenital nasolacrimal duct block, ptosis or lid droop and
            even cataract and glaucoma.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            Infants who are born premature, of low birth weight or who have a
            prolonged tumultuous stay in the newborn nursery, are at risk for a
            disease called Retinopathy of Prematurity, RoP. RoP is potentially
            vision threatening and must be screened for in these high-risk
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            In settings of malnutrition, children are susceptible to Vitamin A
            deficiency, and its attendant eye problems including dry eye,
            corneal ulcers, and even blindness. Fussy and choosy eaters may also
            sometimes be deficient in some micronutrients despite being healthy
            and well fed otherwise.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            Children, because of their active lifestyle and playing outdoors are
            more prone to eye allergies and trauma.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            There is a set of eye tumors and malignancies that are typical of
            infancy and childhood like retinoblastoma.
