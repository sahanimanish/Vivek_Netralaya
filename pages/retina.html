          The retina is like the film of the camera which sends the image to the
          brain for processing. A damaged retina can lead to significant visual
          disturbances many of which may become permanent if not treated in
          time. The retinal diseases are some of the most common causes of a
          permanent loss of vision in many patients, if not treated on time.

          <h2>Problems Associated with Retina</h2>
        </div>
        <h4>
          There are four main types of disorders which are related to the
          retina:
        </h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Diabetic Retinopathy – </span> It is one of the
            most common issues associated with people having diabetes. In
            Diabetic Retinopathy disease, the high blood sugar levels cause
            damage to the blood vessels of the retina and damage it. In the
            advanced stages, it can lead to blindness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Retinopathy Of Prematurity –</span>
            RoP is mainly caused due to the retinal blood vessels developing
            abnormally and affects prematurely born babies. It can also lead to
            retinal detachment and blindness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold"> Age-Related Macular Degeneration – </span>
            The damage of Macula can cause AMD which can lead to a permanent
            vision loss.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Retinal Detachment –</span>
            It is mainly the detachment of the retina from the layer underneath.
            If it is not taken care of properly, there is a chance of a
            permanent vision loss.
          </li>

            <h2>Solutions and Treatment for Retinal Diseases</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            During the initial stages of various retinal diseases, generally, no
            symptoms are seen apart from the change or blurring in vision.
            During the later stages of the disorders, vision losses start to
            occur which may get worse if not treated properly.
          </p>
          <div class="mt-3 blog-img">
            <img src="../img/r1.jpg" alt="structure of retina" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3">
          In case, if one feels that there is a problem in the eye, they should
          immediately consult an eye specialist for further examination. If it
          is a retinal disease, receiving immediate treatment will increase the
          chances of regaining or retaining your vision, and limit further loss.
          During the regular eye checkups or consulting with our professionals,
          we identify various problems of the eye and suggest solutions
          accordingly. During the initial stages of the retinal difficulties,
          generally, some precautions and a set of essential medicines and eye
          drops are recommended for the treatment.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          If the diseases are at advanced stages or they are not being cured
          with the primary treatment, surgery is then recommended after
          examining the eye condition and understanding the patient’s problems.
          This is the time when a highly experienced surgeon would step in and
          identify what type of surgery is needed and what will be the recovery
          time.
