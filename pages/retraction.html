          What Is Eyelid Retraction?

        Eyelid retraction occurs when the upper eyelid remains at an abnormally
        high level over the eye or the lower eyelid rests at a particularly low
        position. This is most noticeable by the exposure of sclera (white part
        of the eye) above or below the iris (colored part of the eye). Normal
        open eyelid positions lay at the top and bottom edges of the iris. When
        the eyelid retracts, this often causes the eye to appear at an open
        position that looks exaggerated and unnatural. Depending on the extent
        of an individual’s condition, they may develop chronic symptoms from
        overexposure of the eyeball.

          What Are the Symptoms of Eyelid Retraction?
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        When the upper and/or lower eyelid is retracted, this can cause a
        variety of symptoms related to the excessive exposure of the eye. The
        most common issues people experience as a result of their eyelid
        retraction include the following:

          What Causes Eyelid Retraction?
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Eyelid retraction most often develops over time but can be a congenital
        disorder. The condition is most prevalent in those with thyroid disease
        (also known as Graves’ disease), especially when it only affects one eye
        (unilateral). Retracted eyelids can also be caused by multiple other
        factors, such as trauma, genetics, tumors, following a stroke, and
        blepharoptosis of the opposite eye. The most prevalent cause of upper
        eyelid retraction is thyroid disease, while lower eyelid retraction most
        commonly results from complications from lower blepharoplasty.

          What Are the Treatments for Eyelid Retraction?
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Treatment for eyelid retraction usually begins with conservative methods
        of symptom management, such as the regular use of eye drops.
        Non-surgical solutions like BOTOX® injections are also frequently used
        to help reduce the amount of retraction present. BOTOX® is especially
        common for helping those suffering from eyelid retraction due to thyroid
        disease. Over time, oculoplastic surgery typically becomes necessary
        since symptoms like dry eye tend to progress.

          What Can I Expect During Eyelid Retraction Surgery?
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        For upper eyelid retraction, surgery involves detaching the levator
        muscle, which is responsible for elevating the upper eyelid. This causes
        the upper eyelid to naturally rest at a lower position. Surgery for
        lower eyelid retraction, on the other hand, varies according to each
        case. This may entail the placement of a graft, a midface lift to raise
        the bottom eyelid, or tightening of the outer eye corner (canthoplasty).
        <br /><br />
        The goal of eyelid retraction surgery is to reduce the abnormally
        round-appearing eyes, revealing less of the sclera above or beneath the
        iris. This helps provide long-term relief from chronic symptoms that can
        cause irritation and blurry vision. It can also help reduce evaporative
        loss which often leads to dry eye.
        <br /><br />
        The most appropriate treatment for a patient’s condition will be
        determined once one of our experienced eye surgeons has had the
        opportunity to review their medical history, perform a physical
        examination, and complete any further testing. For more details about
        eyelid retraction, contact Eye Doctors of Washington to schedule an
        appointment.
